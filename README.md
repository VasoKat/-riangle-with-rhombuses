# Triangle-with-rhombuses
Î¤riangle with rhombuses is a program which draws one triangle, in 2 dimensions,
around which a rhombus will periodically appear.The rhombus appears in
one position for a few seconds, then it gets deleted and appears in the next position.
This process continues until the space key is pressed. The rhombus in each
position has a common point with the triangle. Initially, the rhombus appears on the left
top of the triangle, then to the middle top of the triangle, then to the right top
of the triangle and this process is repeated.The program is in C++/C with the use of Opengl 3.3+.
GLFW, GLEW and GLM libraries and Visual Studio 2022 were used.
This project was done in collaboration with one fellow student.
